## 1. Insurance_Proj.ipynb
  - Statistical Learning Project
  - Data Description:
     The data at hand contains medical costs of people characterized by certain
     attributes.
  - Domain:
     Healthcare
  - Context:
     Leveraging customer information is paramount for most businesses. In the case of an insurance company, attributes of customers like the ones mentioned below can    be crucial in making business decisions. Hence, knowing to explore and generate value out of such data can be an invaluable skill to have. 
     
 ## 2. Bank_Personal loan.ipynb
  - Supervised LearningProject
  - Data Description: The file Bank.xls contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.
  - Domain: BankingContext:This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget


## 3. Parkinson’s Disease-Ensemble Technique.ipynb
  - Ensemble TechniquesProject
  - Data Description & Context: Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a degenerative neurological disorder marked by decreased dopamine levels in the brain. It manifests itself through a deterioration of movement, including the presence of tremors and stiffness. There is commonly a marked effect on speech, including dysarthria (difficulty articulating sounds), hypophonia (lowered volume), and monotone (reduced pitch range). Additionally, cognitive impairments and changes in mood can occur, and risk of dementia is increased.Traditional diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease involves a clinician taking a neurological history of the patient and observing motor skills in various situations. Since there is no definitive laboratory test to diagnose PD, diagnosis is often difficult, particularly in the early stages when motor effects are not yet severe. Monitoring progression of the disease over time requires repeated clinic visits by the patient. An effective screening process, particularly one that doesn’t require a clinic visit, would be beneficial. Since PD patients exhibit characteristic vocal features, voice recordings are a useful and non-invasive tool for diagnosis. If machine learning algorithms could be applied to a voice recording dataset to accurately diagnosis PD, this would be an effective screening step prior to an appointment with a clinician.
